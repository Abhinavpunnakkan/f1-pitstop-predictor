# Monza Pit Stop Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts whether a Formula 1 driver will pit on the next lap â€” built using historical race data from the Monza Grand Prix. The goal is to use this as a stepping stone toward building a full race strategy optimizer.

## Overview

This project uses:
- **Historical lap-by-lap telemetry and timing data**
- **Tyre compounds, life, lap times, and more**
- A **classification ML model** trained on past data to predict pit stops

It was created as part of my learning journey into machine learning through real-world motorsport applications.

## ðŸ“Š Data

- Source: [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/)
- Race: **Monza Grand Prix**
- Data includes:
  - Lap number
  - Tyre compound
  - Tyre life
  - Lap time
  - Driver
  - Pit stop indicator

## ML Model

We used a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict whether a pit stop will occur on the next lap based on current lap conditions.

### ðŸ”§ Features Used
- Driver
- Lap Number
- Tyre Compound
- Tyre Life
- Lap Time
